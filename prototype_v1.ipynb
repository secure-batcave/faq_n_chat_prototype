      "Summary:\n",
      " IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on the internet, with two main versions: IPv4 and IPv6.  IPv4, the older version, uses 32-bit addresses and is nearing capacity due to the increasing number of internet-connected devices. IPv6 solves this problem with 128-bit addresses, offering a practically unlimited supply of unique identifiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "IPv6 also simplifies network configurations and enhances security features like built-in IPsec encryption for data protection.  However, transitioning to IPv6 presents challenges, especially in dual-stack environments where both protocols are used simultaneously. This can create security gaps if monitoring and configuration aren't properly managed for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Questions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* What are the main differences between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses?\n",
      "* Why is IPv6 considered more secure than IPv4?\n",
      "* What are some challenges associated with transitioning to IPv6?\n",
      "* How can cybersecurity professionals mitigate risks in dual-stack environments?\n",
      "* What is IPsec and how is it used in IPv6? \n",
